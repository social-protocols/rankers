# Agenda

- [ ] put upvote share by rank calculation on a scheduler (doesn't need to be recalculated ad hoc, estimation every now and then is enough)
- [ ] refactor model (get rid of unnecessary intermediate structs)
- [ ] once data model is more stable, setup dev workflow with cargo watch
- [ ] so far only happy case programming -> implement proper error handling
- [ ] setup logging
- [ ] create comprehensive api
- [ ] write api documentation and guides
- [ ] create first client library
