# Roadmap

## Milestone 1: Run the Service with a Sophisticated Upvote Share Model

The model should estimate the expected upvote share for the current interval.
Re-training should be run online on a schedule.

## Milestone 2: Create a Client POC

Build and deploy a minimal example app that uses rankers in the backend.
